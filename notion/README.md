# Notion

Notion is a workspace that adapts to your needs. It's as minimal or as powerful as you need it to be. Notion continues to be the easiest way to get information centralized somewhere and shout it out to someone else. For us, that's extremely important because half our team is remote. Notion's ease of use is one of its hallmarks.
