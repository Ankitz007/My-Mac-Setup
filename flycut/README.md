# Flycut

Flycut is a clipboard manager that stores the items copied to the clipboard, making it easy to access them later. It saves the copied items in a history list, which can be accessed by a keyboard shortcut, and then the user can select the required item from the list.

Flycut is very helpful for users who are working on complex projects that require copying and pasting multiple items repeatedly. It eliminates the need to switch between different windows to copy and paste the same content, making the workflow smoother and faster.

Additionally, Flycut is open-source software, which means that it is free to use and can be customized by developers. The software is also lightweight and does not consume significant system resources.

Overall, Flycut is a great tool that can improve the productivity of macOS users by providing a simple and effective way to manage their clipboard.
